## Composition
> Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the [list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

`docker-compose.yml` example:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  my-application1:                # service name, should be unique in docker-compose.yml file
    build: .                      # where Dockerfile locates
    image: my-first-app:2.0       # image name for build
    environment:                  # set of environmental variables
      SLEEP_TIME: 5
      CUSTOM_VARIABLE: "Yohohoho and botle of Rom"

  my-application2:
    image: my-first-app:2.0       # docker client will search for this image locally (at first)
    environment:
      SLEEP_TIME: 100

  my-application3:
    image: my-first-app:2.0
    environment:
      SLEEP_TIME: 17
volumes:
  logvolume01: {}
```

**1-build**
```bash
docker-compose build
```

**2-run in detached mode**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
Output example:
```bash
niks-MBP:docker-compose nik$ docker-compose up -d
Creating network "docker-compose_default" with the default driver
Creating volume "docker-compose_logvolume01" with default driver
Creating docker-compose_my-application2_1 ... done
Creating docker-compose_my-application3_1 ... done
Creating docker-compose_my-application1_1 ... done
```

**3-status**
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
You could also execute `docker ps` to check **RUNNING** containers

**4-logs**
```bash
# logs snapshot
docker-compose logs

# logs snapshot of specific SERVICE
docker-compose logs my-application1

# also flag -f
docker-compose logs -f my-application1
```

**5-stop**
```bash
docker-compose stop

# check that containers are still existed
docker ps -a

# start
docker-compose start
```
`stop/start` commands are used to stop/start all services with availability run them later from the same state when they were stopped.  


**6-down**
```bash
docker-compose down
```
Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
